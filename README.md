# The general logic gate based on a map

Ex. (209) - The general logic gate based on a map, is presented here in three programming languages: Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript. Although the implementations differ in syntax, the underlying concept remains identical across all three versions. Each code sample is reproduced from its respective volume of the series <i>Coding Examples from Simple to Complex</i> (Springer, 2024).
